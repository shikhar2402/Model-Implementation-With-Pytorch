## **Setup Instructions**

This repository uses **uv**, a lightning-fast and efficient tool for managing Python virtual environments. **uv** simplifies the process of creating, activating, and managing environments while ensuring optimal performance for Python projects.

Follow these steps to set up your environment and get started:

1. **Install `uv`**  
   ```bash
   pip install uv
2. **Create a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   uv venv --clear
3. **Activate the virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
4. **Install all requirement using uv**  
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
