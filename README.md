# Machine Learning Collection
In this repository you will find tutorials and projects related to Machine Learning. I try to make the code as clear as possible, and the goal is be to used as a learning resource and a way to lookup problems to solve specific problems. For most I have also done video explanations on YouTube if you want a walkthrough for the code. If you got any questions or suggestions for future videos I prefer if you ask it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/AladdinPersson). This repository is contribution friendly, so if you feel you want to add something then I'd happily merge a PR :smiley:
